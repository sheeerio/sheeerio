### DOOM

So a bunch of e/accs have been floating acrossing my [twitter](https://twitter.com/typeduser) 
and it's been fun to see.

The 'impending' doom cascaded down by the yudkowsky followers has become kind of annoying. And before you 
put me on the spectrum-- I'm equally annoyed by the e/accs.

Transitioning from the idea that AGI is worth achieving that will 'cure' humanity is 
certainly not falsifiable, but many experienced cynics would categorize proponants of such ideas 
as the new 'crypto/nft/web3' guys. I'm not sure how I feel about these two different ideas having such 
social eccentricity correlation.

## Geometry

Geometric Deep learning is so DAMN cool. Like it's quite weird how these topics can be understood easily 
once you get CNNs.

### Note
On a side note, I do also want to acknowledge that most terms used in AI are so exaggerated in terms of 
how BIG they try to sound while just being an insignificant (and intuitive) change in some prior conceptual formula.

Is it just me or did the old school naming conventions (naming based on functionality) seem ~1-2x better than the new 
Considerably Obnoxious Oblonged Lengthy fuckin' abbreviations.

Fuck that.

Cool things I dug up-
