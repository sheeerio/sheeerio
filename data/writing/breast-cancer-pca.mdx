> I wrote this quite a while ago, and while I figure out something to write on, here's something that is difficult to understand because it's a first draft.

English is alive. what if instead of hydrogen popping out of nothingness, it was math, like 0s and 1s. just fucking think about it. Before the universe, there was NO LIMIT to what could be MADE, and there was no time. like why the fuck would it start with hydrogen, why. couldn't it have been something else. OK. they say the periodic table is like the ABCD of chemistry, you need to know that in order to know the subject. but if we never knew the periodic table, the elements would still be interacting right? the same way right? it only made it easier right? Let's treat hydrogen as 1. 1 as in mathematics. 1 can be used to make more 1s and even more numbers. Almost as if it had no limits. 1 can have infinite things inside it, from the binary code of everything you see with a decimal point in front of it, to art. There is no limit in mathematics. and there is no limit in this universe. Let's go back to hydrogen for a second. Hydrogen is made up of electrons, and those electrons are made of quarks. Now, riddle me with this. "Is there infinite space inside a centimeter?" you'd probably say no. and it's false. there is, at least to me, infinite space inside a centimeter. for there are infinite numbers. That amount of space just isn't useful enough for us to be significant. so there is a picometer, sure. beyond it? there's space too. and beyond that? more space. It's just too small for us to even comprehend it's vastness. 0 has always been a famous digit in the world of mathematics. because you can't have it, unless you have it. 0 is nothing, you can't just use 0s to make new numbers. you can't. it's nothing. and so is our comprehension about the word 'nothing'. have we ever felt it? Hopefully not. have we seen nothing? no. I do agree when they say that mathematics is the language of the universe. for it is a universe in itself. it's not evolved too much. but the logic is. for it has always been. it's a universe we can control and comprehend in our brain. there's life in it that we cannot see. there's life in english, the alphabet that made the words, that made the sentences, that change us, that have life of their own. isn't that fascinating? forget english, and take any language in the world. how is the most primitive building block used to create infinity. there's an online library where you can find anything. and it has a limit. and i wondered, is there? what if we never stopped, like what if there was no limit to what we could think. would it still be in the babel? That's why it has a character limit in the search space. For we are meant never to see infinity. see? we created infinity from nothing. wait. so I said that there is infinite space in finite space. does that mean that we [humans] consume infinite space and so we are basically, infinity? Is it so? Are we infinity? Why do we have limits then? It’s because we have boundaries, not limits. isn't there any limit? Why would a limit be in this universe? The only thing that can be. is infinity. and we are a part of it. for it is not something to be comprehended. It is an idea. it is made for us to imagine what cannot be imagined. it is for us to take a glance and rethink. Infinity makes you humble. is infinity... god? 

God made the universe? Infinity made the universe? What was there before the big bang? No time. No space. Quite possibly nothing. Just one of the two things we may never be able to comprehend. But we can use it. I give infinity infinity/5 stars. 


I feel like this is why we need to be humble. For we are alive. Alive with a finite sense of the infinite world. But I think what controls infinity is time. Which has a limit, as we created it. We created time. It is just an expression which says to us, ‘we are alive, together.’ Time is the only thing that can prove it. Remove time, and there’s no life. Stop Time and there’s no life. Make more time, and there is life. We need to be humble. We need to have limits. For if we don’t, we might become the next infinite. And that would be the equivalent of god. But what does that mean? 
I mean sure, we can’t really be infinite because of time. But, what is I? Is ‘I’ referring to humanity or the You? Maybe both. 
But we can be the gods of our own universes. We can be the gods of our own future. We can be the one we Call God. Only bounded by time. 

Side note-It is funny how google doc finds errors when there are none. I had an idea, and you would get that idea. Why do we need the wrong word then? It tried to correct ‘there is infinite space in finite space’ to ‘there is infinite space in infinite space’. Almost as if it knew what it meant.


Did I really write this just for myself or do I want people to read this? Don’t know *yet*.
